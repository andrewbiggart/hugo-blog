Just before I call website done and abandon it, I like to go through these to make sure everything is in place.

This my personal list that I put together over time, I know there's lots of different checklists out there already but I made my own with the resources I found most useful and the ones I like to use. I included other similar checklists at the bottom of the page, just for completion.
